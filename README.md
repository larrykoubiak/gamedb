# GameDB

GameDB turns a retained RomVault export into a browsable, preference-ranked game
catalog. The code is split into three applications with distinct ownership:

| Package | Owns | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gamedb.derive` | `ref` and `derived`: source interpretation and stable inventory | `python -m gamedb derive` |
| `gamedb.catalog` | `catalog`: consumer projection, facts, identity and score cache | `python -m gamedb rebuild` |
| `gamedb.explorer` | Read-only HTTP pages and queries | `python -m gamedb serve` |

The data flow is deliberately one-way:

```text
staging.rv_files + data/reference
                  │
                  ▼
       Python derivation pass
       ref + derived
       DATs, systems, packages, paths, files,
       titles, raw tags, typed assertions, media
                  │
                  ▼
       SQL consumer projection
       catalog systems, titles, releases, facts,
       exact-content identity and cached ranking
                  │
                  ▼
             explorer
```

The two executable manifests tell that story in detail:

- [`derive.yml`](derive.yml) declares the Python extraction layers.
- [`pipeline.yml`](pipeline.yml) declares the downstream SQL projection layers.

## Running only what changed

A full derivation is destructive and must be explicit:

```sh
python -m gamedb derive --plan
python -m gamedb derive --rebuild
```

Routine changes select their actual boundary. They do not silently replay
staging, path resolution, or name parsing:

```sh
# A path mapping changed
python -m gamedb derive --layers paths

# Parser/classifier rules changed; stable inventory is reused
python -m gamedb derive --from-layer names

# A user preference changed; derived data is untouched
python -m gamedb rebuild --layers scoring
```

After a full derivation, build the complete consumer projection with
`python -m gamedb rebuild`. Use `--plan`, `--layers`, `--from-layer`, or
`--through-layer` to inspect or select its SQL layers.

## Inspecting names

The parser can be exercised without changing the database:

```sh
python -m gamedb parse-name No-Intro 'Example (USA) (En,Fr).zip' --classify
```

See [the database model](docs/database.md), [archive-name rules](docs/archive_names.md),
[current status](docs/status.md), and [SQL index](sql/README.md).

## Explorer

After catalog and scoring have been built, run `python -m gamedb serve` and open
`http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Set `GAMEDB_EXPLORER_PORT=8080` in `.env` to change the
Docker host port, or pass `--port` locally.

The Dockerfile exposes independent targets:

```sh
docker compose --profile tools run --build --rm deriver \
  python -m gamedb.derive --plan
docker compose --profile tools run --build --rm catalog-builder \
  python -m gamedb.catalog rebuild --layers scoring
docker compose up --build explorer
```

## Verification

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Connection settings live in the ignored `.env`; exported shell values take
precedence.
